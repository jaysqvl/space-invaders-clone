# java-space-invaders
# My basic rendition on Space Invaders using basic libraries.
# Unfinished and unorganized code that needs work.

# Things to be accomplished:
# 	- Menu buttons need to work
# 		- Possible splash screen
# 	- Point system using draw in the top right corner
# 	- Multiple levels
# 	- New Monsters
# 	- Time complexity to reduce memory usage

# Currently unexecutable and created in JDK Environment 12+
